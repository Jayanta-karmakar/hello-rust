# Rust Learning Journey ðŸ¦€

Welcome to my Rust learning repository. This space captures my journey as I delve into the exciting world of Rust programming.

## Learning Resources

I'm relying on the following resources to enhance my Rust skills:

* :star: [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) - [repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/book)
*  [GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-rust-programming-language/)
*  [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Az3jBd4xdF4&list=PLLqEtX6ql2EyPAZ1M2_C0GgVd4A-_L4_5)
*  [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R33h77nrMqc&list=PLPoSdR46FgI412aItyJhj2bF66cudB6Qs)

## How to Run the Code

If you want to try out any of the code snippets or projects:

1. Pull the code from repo to your local directory
2. then run these commands in your local terminal

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. I'm open to suggestions and collaboration!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
